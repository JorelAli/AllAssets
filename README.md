========

A plugin which does everything a server would ever possibly need.
Hmm. a readme file. I should sort this out when I get the chance to.

What it is
----------
Pretty simply put - this plugin is aimed to be the 'best plugin a server could ever need'
It is designed with speed, simplicity and ease of use in mind, so even brand new server owners can get to grips with it.

Also desgined to be as light weight as possible (compared to Essentials) and supposed to be really easy to use.

Compiling
---------
If you want to compile it... Well, I'm gonna make a folder later where you can download the pre-releases of it, but BE WARNED, it may be REALLY buggy!
