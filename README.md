AllAssets
========

A plugin which does everything a server would ever possibly need.
Hmm. a readme file. I should sort this out when I get the chance to.

What it is
----------
Pretty simply put - this plugin is aimed to be the 'best plugin a server could ever need'
It is designed with speed, simplicity and ease of use in mind, so even brand new server owners can get to grips with it.

Also desgined to be as light weight as possible (compared to Essentials) and supposed to be really easy to use.

Compiling
---------
Not allowed. You could do it if you want to, but I prefer you'd use the AllAssets.jar file inside the /builds/ folder
