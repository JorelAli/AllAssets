AllAssets
========

A plugin which does everything a server would ever possibly need.
Hmm. a readme file. I should sort this out when I get the chance to.

What it is
----------
Pretty simply put - this plugin is aimed to be the 'best plugin a server could ever need'
It is designed with speed, simplicity and ease of use in mind, so even brand new server owners can get to grips with it.

Also desgined to be as light weight as possible (compared to Essentials) and supposed to be really easy to use.

Compiling
---------
Not allowed. You could do it if you want to, but I prefer you'd use the AllAssets.jar file inside the /builds/ folder (since the builds there have less bugs than these default development builds - and sometimes development builds crash. A lot!)

About
-----
Skepter, the single developer of AllAssets hated Essentials. He hated how it was easy to exploit teleporting by using /tpahere on himself whilst standing on the corner of a block and teleporting to a location far below him (easy way to descend canyons without the descend permission xD). He hated the massive (and amount) of files required - Essentials, EssentialsSpawn/Protect/Chat etc. He hated the system of removing commands by opening the jar file and removing it from Essentials' plugin.yml. He planned on creating a new plugin which would be:
* The successor to his older plugin called NecessaryExtras
* A plugin that was better better than Essentials
* A more 'user friendly' plugin which would also have advanced features

Upon creation, he named his project AllInOne, until his friend told him that a plugin was already named by that. Since then, after some help with friends (ajcozzo, Gerrie_K, amoniuszko20) he renamed his project to 'AllAssets'.
The most unique thing about this plugin is, most large plugins such as CommandBook and Essentials for example were normally created with a collaboration of developers, however AllAssets was coded entirely (excepting the libraries) by one single developer - Skepter.
