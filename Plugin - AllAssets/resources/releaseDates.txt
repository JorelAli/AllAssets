Release date information (from Skepter)

From 2nd April until 27th April, I'll be away on my Easter holiday which will be jam packed of revision 
for the exams which start in May (8th May) until June (19th June). And then I'll do 
something like relaxing until around 9th July where my school ends.

I want a decent Title API (in /libs/ folder) to be finished (see CommandTitle) which 
will add subtitles and other variable information. I want trails and a PotionGUI completed 
all by version 0.7 Alpha.

After 0.7 Alpha has been released, I want you to start working on 0.8 which will consist 
of the more 'technical' side of AllAssets (Economy/Chat/Permissions) as well as advanced 
data storage (Banning/Kicking/Tempbanning) and the implementation of MySQL and 
SQLite (which has partially been implemented).

For version 0.85, I am predicting a messagingAPI which will allow player to player 
communication. (msg/reply/mail/ignore) and the end of the main 
OP commands (kill/freeze/unlimited (infinite)/spawner/xp) etc.

That way, by 0.9 Alpha, (set to release by August 25th (my Birthday)), 
AllAssets will be practically complete. From then onwards, I will leave pretty much 
80% of the project to you since I'll be heading off to France and then straight after 
that into my A-Level life. (Sixth Form).

I estimate AllAssets to enter 1.0 Beta stage by Christmas.
