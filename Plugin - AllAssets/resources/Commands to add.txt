* Ban - I want a custom data file which stores the person 
who banned the player as well as the banned player, along 
with the reason for their ban (TextUtils.getMsgFromArgs() 
and the CustomConfig class)

* Broadcast - A really easy broadcast system. I want the 
broadcast 'prefix' to be set in either the config.yml or 
messages.yml. I haven't decided yet. Until then, keep it 
hardcoded (String prefix = [THE PREFIX]) Put some color 
into it :)

* Rules - Reading off of a custom rules.yml file. Simple 
as that. Adding /rules add and /rules remove to add/remove 
rules on the go for admins

* World - Teleport to different worlds (Bukkit.getWorld(String name)). 
Teleport them to the world spawnpoint (world.getSpawnLocation() and 
player.teleport(Location loc))

* Go - A 'jump' command (similar to WorldEdit's compass which 
teleports you directly to the location they are looking at 
(player.getTargetBlock(new HashSet<Material>(), 256).getLocation)
