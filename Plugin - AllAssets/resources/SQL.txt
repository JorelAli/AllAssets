--- SQL information ---

[Where it will be used]
SQL will be used for storing massive information about players.
For example, we will be using SQL to store:
* Economy information
  - Recent purchases perhaps?
* Permission information
* Banned players

We will NOT use it to store:
* Chat information (affixes etc.)

In 0.8 Alpha, we're gonna implement
MySQL as an option for SQLite (default to SQLite if not
chosen) (Have some option to 'convert' from SQLite to MySQL)
