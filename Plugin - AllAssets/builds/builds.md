Builds
======
This is the builds folder, where you are able to download the latest builds of AllAssets. In order to download a build of AllAssets, right click the AllAssets.zip file and click 'Save link as'.
That's pretty much it xD There will always be only 1 file in here (since it's still in dev stage) and yeah. pretty much. Just look for those commits to see if a new AllAssets.zip file has been uploaded since it is likely to have some patched bugs.

Each AllAssets.zip file contains:
* AllAssets.jar - this is the file which you place inside the /plugins/ folder of your server
* Changelog.txt - this shows the differences from each new version and the possible bugs which it contains
* Disclaimer.txt - the data shown below

Disclaimer (or whatever you call it)
------------------------------------
These builds are 'for experimental purposes' and should be used at your own risk. I am NOT liable for any damage this causes to your server.
The builds are allowed for these purposes (and these only!):
* Experimenting with the plugin (and getting to know it)
* Seeing the code in action
* Getting a free early build before the actual thing comes out so you can use it on your server like amoniuszko20

These builds are NOT to be used for these purposes:
* Distribution (so you can't give it to other people, but you can give them the link)
* Making money from it (So you can't sell it to other people, it's FREE FOR ALL)
* Putting on a 'proper' server (So like your main server or something. You ARE allowed to put it onto a testing server or something along the lines of that)
* Blackmailing people (idk -.-)
* Anything stupid.

Don't decompile the builds, it's pointless since the source code is on github -.-
