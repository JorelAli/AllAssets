Builds
======
This is the builds folder, where you are able to download the latest builds of AllAssets. PLEASE NOTE: Some of the classes have been used from OTHER libraries and I have not yet finished the legal implications. Therefore, distribution apart from this website is 100% COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN for you may be breaking legal acts which can cause pretty bad stuff in the future.

Jar file
--------
In order to download a build of AllAssets, right click the AllAssets.jar file and click 'Save link as'.
Then go ahead and put it in your /plugins/ folder and you're set to go :)

Zip file
--------
In order to download a build of AllAssets, right click the AllAssets.zip file and click 'Save link as'.
That's pretty much it xD There will always be only 1 file in here (since it's still in dev stage) and yeah. pretty much. Just look for those commits to see if a new AllAssets.zip file has been uploaded since it is likely to have some patched bugs.

Each AllAssets.zip file contains:
* AllAssets.jar - this is the file which you place inside the /plugins/ folder of your server
* Changelog.txt - this shows the differences from each new version and the possible bugs which it contains
* Disclaimer.txt - the data shown below

Disclaimer - normal builds
--------------------------
These are builds which have been announced on Enjin or my website. You are free to experiment and view the source code as well as put it on whatever server you want.

Distribution, selling or claiming it as your own is COMPLETELY forbidden - if anyone is caught doing so, AllAssets may be taken down to prevent further copyright theft.

Disclaimer - unannounced builds
-------------------------------
These builds are 'for experimental purposes' and should be used at your own risk. I am NOT liable for any damage this causes to your server.
The builds are allowed for these purposes (and these only!):
* Experimenting with the plugin (and getting to know it)
* Seeing the code in action
* Getting a free early build before the actual thing comes out so you can use it on your server

These builds are NOT to be used for these purposes:
* Distribution (so you can't give it to other people, but you can give them the link)
* Making money from it (So you can't sell it to other people, it's FREE FOR ALL)
* Putting on a 'proper' server (So like your main server or something. You ARE allowed to put it onto a testing server or something along the lines of that)
* Blackmailing people (idk -.-)
* Anything stupid.

Don't decompile the builds, it's pointless since the source code is on github -.-
