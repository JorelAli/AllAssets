If you need help getting started, you have come to the right place! This little document will show how to use this plugin to its fullest and hope you have the best server you could possibly have!

=== Installation ===
To install from the .zip version, open the AllAssets.zip file and extract the .jar file. Then, place this file inside your /plugins/ directory.

Q: I don't see a /plugins/ directory!
A: If you don't see a plugins directory, start up your server and it should generate. If it does not generate, please use CraftBukkit (this does not work on Vanilla Minecraft).

=== Usage (Configuration) ===
To use the configuration system, there are 2 files - config.yml, messages.yml and features.yml. 

Config.yml is mainly based on adjusting small values and adding variability to the plugin. For example, if you don't want to clear armor when you use the /clear command, you can set it to 'false' under 'clearArmor'

Messages.yml is for adjusting text messages. For example you can change the error message when you cannot enchant a specific item.

Features.yml is for enabling and disabling certain features in the plugin. For example, if you didn't want the /ConsoleLog command (at all), you can set it to false in the Features.yml and it will be COMPLETELY removed (the command will not even be loaded and thus will come up as an unknown command).

=== Usage (Commands) ===
* /allassets commands - shows a list of commands

If you encounter errors, please send Skepter the error in the format of:
* What you were trying to do (e.g. run /batch command)
* What happened (e.g. error in console, nothing happens)
* If there was an error in the console, please send the ENTIRE error log (not the whole server log, the error log. I need it to fix errors)
