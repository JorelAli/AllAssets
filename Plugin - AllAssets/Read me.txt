=== Installation ===
To install from the .zip version, open the AllAssets.zip file and extract the .jar file. Then, place this file inside your /plugins/ directory.

Q: I don't see a /plugins/ directory!
A: If you don't see a plugins directory, start up your server and it should generate. If it does not generate, please use CraftBukkit (this does not work on Vanilla Minecraft).
