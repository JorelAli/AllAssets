	 * Finally! After figuring out how to use the VaultAPI, I can begin working on a permission section :D
	 * 
	 * Command list (things to put into this section)
	 * 
	 * A command to see the heirarchy
	 * World permissions
	 * Listings of everything (users etc.)
	 * - List user will show their permissions, prefix/suffix
	 * A way of adding perms for a user IN A CERTAIN WORLD
	 * """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" GLOBALLY
	 * A way of undoing what I just said (removing it)
	 * 
	 * Creating groups
	 * Group world perms
	 * Group prefixes
	 * Inheritence - perhaps use a GUI for this? Seems cleaner
	 * 
	 * A simple promote/demote command - a way of setting heiarachy
	 * 
	 * Checking stuff (if <player> has perm)
	 * 
	 * save/load - store in .yml for easy cheesy management
