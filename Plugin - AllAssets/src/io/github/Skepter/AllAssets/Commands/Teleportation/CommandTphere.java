 *     - If it was setup incorrectly or you used a non-official build, you can NOT hold me liable for that.
 * * Yell at me:
 *     - If something is wrong, please approach the situation calmly.
 * * Modify the code:
 *     - You are NOT allowed to 'steal' the whole code from Github, modify it, compile it yourself and distribute that.
