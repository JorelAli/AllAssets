 * * Experiment with the code to your wish
 * * Download it to use on your server

 * You are NOT able to:
 * * Sell AllAssets - it is COMPLETELY free for ALL users
 * * Claim it as your own. AllAssets is created by Skepter
 * * Distribute it on any other website. The ONLY places where it can be downloaded from is github and the Bukkit repository
 * * Decompile the code - it's COMPLETELY unnecessary since the entire code is on Github. The only exception is the BukkitDev staff who I have allowed permission to decompile (to search for malicious code)

 * You can not:
 * * Hold me liable for your actions:
 *     - If there is a bug in the program, you are allowed to notify me.
 *     - If other players abuse AllAssets, you are NOT allowed to hold me liable for that
 *     - If it was setup incorrectly or you used a non-official build, you can NOT hold me liable for that.
 * * Yell at me:
 *     - If something is wrong, please approach the situation calmly.
 * * Modify the code:
 *     - You are NOT allowed to 'steal' the whole code from Github, modify it, compile it yourself and distribute that.
