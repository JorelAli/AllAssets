Builds
======
This is the builds folder, where you are able to download the latest builds of AIO. In order to download a build of AIO, right click the AllInOne.jar file and click 'save as'.
That's pretty much it xD There will always be only 1 file in here (since it's still in dev stage) and yeah. pretty much. Just look for those commits to see if a new AllInOne.jar file has been uploaded since it is likely to have some patched bugs

Disclaimer (or whatever you call it)
------------------------------------
These builds are 'for experimental purposes' and SHOULD NOT be used on a proper server.
The builds are allowed for these purposes (and these only!):
* Experimenting with the plugin (and getting to know it)
* Seeing the code in action

These builds are NOT to be used for these purposes:
* Distribution (so you can't give it to other people, but you can give them the link)
* Making money from it (So you can't sell it to other people, it's FREE FOR ALL)
* Putting on a 'proper' server (So like your main server or something. You ARE allowed to put it onto a testing server or something along the lines of that)
* Blackmailing people (idk -.-)
* Anything stupid.

Don't decompile the builds, it's pointless since the source code is on github -.-
