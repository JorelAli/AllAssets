Review - ajcozzo - Version 0.2 Alpha
------------------------------------
AllAssets is definitely an Alpha level plugin. However, what it presents is a very, VERY impressive amount of improvements to Essentials. It also has quite a few of it's own, also very impressive and/or helpful additions (such as batch, bind, or the new idea for the enchant GUI). While I have not had the chance to test out all of the configurations and non-command features of the plugin, what I have tested has been wonderful. Let me remind anyone who sees this review, this is an alpha, and as such, it will have bugs. The identifiable bugs that I noticed were not significant to the plugin's main function (I.E. nothing crashed), and presumably (as I am not the developer, nor have I read the source code) easy fixes. Overall, I would say that once this plugin is completed, it would be hard to argue for Essentials over AllAssets. As far as I am concerned, this is a very impressive alpha, especially for a single person to accomplish. I'm no plugin critic, but if I were, I'd give AllAssets an overall rating of around 9.5/10 as a first edition alpha (a perfect score would not be something that should be in alpha).
